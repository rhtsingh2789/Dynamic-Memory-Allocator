The files "g2hdos.exe" and "g2hwin.exe" are MS-DOS and MS-WINDOWS executables,
respectively.  The MS-DOS version is useful only for small GEDCOMS of under
about 100K bytes, as the program cannot make use of extended or expanded
memory.  The MS-WINDOWS version can process much larger GEDCOMS, depending
on the amount of memory and swap area available to the system.  As the MS-DOS
filesystem appears to use a file creation algorithm that takes time quadratic
in the number of entries in a directory, if too many files are created in
one directory the program starts to run very slowly.  Thus, under MS-DOS or
MS-WINDOWS, the default is to create several subdirectories for the individual
HTML files, and to limit the number of files per subdirectory to 100.
The default value can be overridden with the "-d" option.
